# Module 2: Core Objects
The goal of Module 2 of this course is to reinforce the core programming concepts introduced in Module 1 and apply them to solve to problems you might encounter.
In addition to these existing concepts:

* Numbers (int, bool, float)
* Sequences (string, list)
* Relation and Logic Operators
* Conditionals
* For Loops

We will introduce the concept of **reading and writing files** with Python. We will use numbers, sequences, operators, conditionals, and for loops to work with data from files in the assignments. You will also complete a series of Projects from the text chosen to reinforce the concepts from Module 1.
