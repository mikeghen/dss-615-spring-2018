# Module 3: Control Flow
The goal of Module 3 of this course is to **learn to control the flow of programs**. We will move beyond _simple scripts_ and start building what would be considered _applications_.

As we start to think about control flow, we will being to explore the concept of functions. As we move into the second half of this course where we focus on object oriented programing, functions become an important topic. We will start discussing it this week and continue more in subsequent weeks.
