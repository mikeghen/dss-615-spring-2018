# Module 1: Introduction
The goal of Module 1 of this course is to get you up to speed with these basic programming concepts:

* Numbers (int, bool, float)
* Sequences (string, list)
* Relation and Logic Operators
* Conditionals
* For Loops

We will focus on these topics for the first 3 weeks of this course, apply them much more in Module 2 and 3. To get you up to speed, here is your assignment for this week.

## Reading Assignment:
* Textbook
  * Chapter 1
  * Chapter 2 sections 1, 2, and 4
  * Chapter 3 sections 1, 2, and 4
* Python Documentation
